* Stitching

*** Convert to mp4
    ffmpeg -f concat -i <(printf "file '$PWD/%s'\n" ./*.MP4) -c copy output.MP4
    (doc on concat: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate)
*** Re-mux mp4 to avi
    ffmpeg -I joined.mp4 -vcodec copy -r 29.97 -an joined.avi
*** Media share
    FP1MEDIA
*** Local videos
    ~/Videos/
*** Video share
    smb://fp1media/Fin_Print_Video/
    mounted on machine at /media/windowsshare
**** Add to /etc/fstab
     //10.0.108.102/Fin_Print_Video /media/video_share cifs username=svc_hdcopy,password=Chdl2004,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0
     //10.0.106.81/Fin_Print1_44TB /media/fishy_44 cifs username=svc_hdcopy,password=Chdl2004,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0

     (without the uid and gid, only root will have write access)
     Must reboot for this to take effect, "mount -a" is insufficient
** Bulk stitching script
*** Use
    Two files, bulk_stitch.py, concat_mpeg.sh. From folder containing these files:
    - python3 bulk_stitch.py <root_input_dir> <output_dir>
    Will walk through root_input_dir, stitching videos found in the same folder. Output_dir will match
    original folder structure, but will contain joined versions of the mp4s, remuxed to avi. Each video
    will be called "joined.avi".
*** Setting up the machine
    - sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
    - sudo apt install python3
    - sudo apt install pip3
    - sudo apt install ipython3
    - pip3 install click
    - Machine must already have ffmpeg and appropriate encoders.
*** Windows machine
    - install python
    - install pip
    - pip install openpyxl (only necessary for rename)
    - pip install click
    - install ffmpeg
*** Additional considerations
    - Run time is long. Using screen would be a very good idea. 
      (see: https://www.rackaid.com/blog/linux-screen-tutorial-and-how-to/)
    - Reattach to screen with "screen -r"
** Bulk rename script
   python3 rename_videos.py /media/video_share/tmp/ sherman.xlsx /media/video_share/Sol_Island_Dec_2015/ &> rename.log
** Assumptions
   - Spreadsheet will map videos to sets
   - Folder in spreadsheet is accurate
   - One or two videos per set
     - If two, one will be in a folder that starts with "L", the other with "R"
   - All files for stitching will be in a single folder, and will be the only mp4s in that folder
